<h1>I'M NOT BLACK</h1>
I’m not black I’m African<br /> 
My skin color doesn’t define me<br />
But my heritage does<br />
The choices I make<br />
And path I take<br />
Glorify my blood; my people<br />
Not your stereotype.<br />

I’m not black I’m African<br /> 
My strength is who I am<br />
My weakness is who I’m not<br />
I am that I am<br />
And I am not black<br />
I am African<br />

You call me black<br />
Because black is the absence of light<br />
And thus you make me feel as if I’m living in darkness<br />
You call me black<br />
Because you wear black on funerals<br />
And thus you imply that my dreams are dead<br />
You call me black<br />
Because black rhymes with lack<br />
And white with might<br />
So that you make me feel like I will never have enough<br /> 
You call me black<br />
Because black is for the devil<br />
And white for angels and saints<br />
And so you make me believe that<br />
God cursed my soul beyond redemption<br />
You call me black<br />
Because Black Friday is cheap<br />
And so you convince me that I can’t afford freedom<br />
You call me black<br />
Because black cloth absorbs the most heat<br />
And so you use that as an excuse <br />
To beat me and my people down and discredit my pain<br />

I’m not black, I’m African<br /> 
Because Africa is wealth<br />
Africa has culture<br />
Africa has swag<br />
Black is nothing but void<br />
Black is a hole that sucks you up in a whirlwind of oppression<br /> 
And never gives you the chance to escape.<br />
Black is stress<br />
Black is death<br />
Black is disaster<br /> 
Black is nothing<br />
So don’t call me black<br />
I’m not black<br />
I’m African.<br />
